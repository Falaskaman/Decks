If you want to reliably (90%) have drawn 3 snow cards by turn 3 on the play, you need 28-29 snow cards in your deck.

If you're ok with 2 snow cards by turn 3 on the play, you would need 21-22 snow cards in your deck.

This is a simplification, but gives you an idea of the numbers.

(Important note: in practical terms, fetchlands also count as snow cards)
