Basics
    Each player starts with 7 cards in hand
    High roll to see who goes first, each player starts at 20 life. whoever dies first loses
    60 cards in each deck (a little more than 1/3 are lands)
    only 4 copies of each card (except basic lands)
    these are general rules and should be followed at all times EXCEPT when a card specifies otherwise
        ex. ".... enters the battlefield tapped" will override the default rule that everything enters untapped

Turn Phases
*Untap
    untap all of your cards on the table
*Upkeep
    ignore unless a card mentions the upkeep
*Draw
    The first player does not draw on thier first turn
*Main phase 1
    can play 1 land a turn
    everything enters untapped
    can play any card
*Attack phase
    you do not have to attack, and if you do you do not have to attack with all creatures
    creature cannot have been cast this turn
    choose which of your creatures will attack, tap them
    then your opponent chooses which creatures (if any) will block each attacker
        to block a creature must be untapped
        blocking does not tap creatures
    when attackers and blockers are set, damage is dealt
        creatures deal damage to each other at the same time
        unblocked creatures deal damage to the player
*Main phase (you do not have to play anything)
    same as above (if you played a land earlier you cannot now)
